# Implementation-of-NB-IoT-Software-Defined-Radio-SDR-
The project aims to simulate 8 NB-IoT devices transmitting their UL signal to the NB-IoT base station. The NB-IoT mode is the Standalone mode in which the NB-IoT carrier is deployed outside the LTE spectrum, e.g., in the spectrum used for GSM or satellite communications.
